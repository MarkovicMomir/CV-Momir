# CV-Momir

My CV. Made as a website (http://momir.atwebpages.com) .

## About

A website designed to show some of my web developing skills (mostly considering JavaScript functionalities and connection with the backend (without some awesome design)!').

## Installation

1. For working with the backend and database on your local machine you need to have some local server (like 'Wampserver' or 'XAMPP' or some else) installed and started. With frontend alone, you can work with a browser only (no need for a local server).

2. To work from the command line with 'bash' scripting you need to have some terminal application (like 'Git Bash') installed and started.

3. In your command line, change your working directory's position to your local server's 'localhost' directory. Example for the 'localhost' of the 'Wampserver' for the 64-bit machine- c/WAMP64/www:
   ```bash
   cd /c/WAMP64/www
   ```

4. Clone the repository on your local server (using the command line):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MarkovicMomir/CV-Momir.git
   ```

5. Now you can open 'localhost' in the browser (just type: 'localhost' in the address line)...

You may do the similar directly using an editor that has git options (like Visual Studio Code).
